# Guarz React Application

....

## Startup

To run a standalone client instance on the development server:

- Make sure SSR is turned on: switch `ssr` to `true` inside `react-router.config.ts`

## Dilemmas

- should I create a React project from scratch or bootstrap?
- create form functionality from scratch?
- A user should only be able to retrieve his own submitted data, how do I differenciate between users?
first thought is by IP, but I can't send the IP address from the client since a malicious actor can spoof it(?)
